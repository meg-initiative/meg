# Contributing to the MEG Protocol

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Minimal Ethical Governance (MEG) standard! We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, ethicists, and the public to help us make this protocol as robust and effective as possible.

## How to Contribute

We manage contributions to the protocol itself through the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/meg-initiative/meg/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/meg-initiative/meg/pulls) on this repository.

### Reporting Issues or Proposing Changes

If you find an ambiguity, a potential loophole, or have a suggestion for improving the protocol, the best way to start is by **opening an issue**.

1.  **Check existing issues:** Before creating a new issue, please check if a similar topic is already being discussed.
2.  **Create a new issue:** Use a clear and descriptive title. In the body, please explain:
    *   **The Problem:** Which article or concept is unclear or problematic?
    *   **The Rationale:** Why is this a problem? What are the potential negative consequences?
    *   **The Proposed Solution:** How would you suggest clarifying or changing the text? Please be as specific as possible.

### Submitting a Pull Request

For direct modifications to the documentation (e.g., fixing a typo, clarifying a sentence, proposing a new article), please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Create a new branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature` or `fix/typo-in-article-1`).
3.  **Make your changes.**
4.  **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of the changes you've made and why. Please link the PR to any relevant issues.
