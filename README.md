### What is MEG?

Minimal Ethical Governance (MEG) is an open-source, engine-agnostic technical standard designed to make any AI system demonstrably safe, transparent, and accountable. 
It translates abstract ethical principles into concrete, auditable engineering requirements.

**This repository contains the official MEG Core Protocol specifications, the project roadmap, and governance documents.** For the official implementation and SDK, 
please visit the [**meg-sdk repository**](https://github.com/meg-initiative/meg-sdk).

### Why MEG Matters

| For Whom? | What it Provides |
| :--- | :--- |
| **For AI Users** | **Safety Guarantees & The Right to Proof.** Users are protected by an independently audited standard and have cryptographic proof of every interaction. |
| **For Developers** | **A Clear Path to Compliance & A Competitive Edge.** MEG provides a concrete roadmap to building trustworthy AI, turning ethical compliance from a burden into a feature. |
| **For the Ecosystem**| **A Shared Foundation for Trust.** MEG creates a universal standard for safety and data handling, enabling different AI systems to interact responsibly. |

### Compliance Tiers

MEG is designed for scalable adoption. The protocol is structured in three tiers, allowing projects to adopt a level of compliance that matches their impact and resources.
| Feature | **Level 1: BRONZE** | **Level 2: SILVER** | **Level 3: GOLD** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Philosophy** | Foundational Safety | Proactive Accountability | Cognitive Partnership |
| **Core Guarantee** | Verifiable Logging & Basic Safety | Real-Time Reliability Metrics (DAI/ISR) | Cognitive Integrity Protection (MSC) |
| **Target Audience** | Open-Source Models, Research | Business Applications, Medium-Impact | Critical Domains (Medical, Financial) |
